**

For the above code after sleep 8th statement, you're defining state with "ok" and using state variable in while loop. This will never executed 
in any circumstatnces.
And also You're not confirming the system is properly in 'shutdown'.


You can replace the above code with the below code
**
Stop = ec2.stop_instances(
                InstanceIds=[iid]
                )

ec2.get_waiter('instance_stopped').wait(
    DryRun=False,
    InstanceIds=[iid]
)
logging.info('The %s volume %s is being deattached:' % (vtype, nvid))
**
